 * Investment insight agent — the "learns your activity and produces insight"
 * capability. Read→synthesize→remember, the same agentic shape as memory
 * consolidation, so it runs on the same FREE LOCAL model (never bills).
 *
 * SCOPE: descriptive and observational ONLY — concentration, drift, notable
 * moves, things to look at. It must NOT give buy/sell recommendations or
 * personalized investment advice; it reports what the numbers show.
 *
 * Manual-only (defaultSchedule: null) during validation — trigger it yourself,
 * judge the quality, and flip it to a weekly cron once it proves out.
