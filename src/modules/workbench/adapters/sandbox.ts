/**
 * Harness isolation (Tier 1 + Tier 2).
 *
 * Every Workbench CLI harness used to run under the user's real `$HOME`, so a
 * delegated run read AND wrote the user's global `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`,
 * opencode caches, etc. (claude-headless even had a bespoke hack to scrub the
 * auto-memory it left in `~/.claude/projects`). This module gives each harness
 * a private, writable HOME under `~/.aios/harness-home/<kind>` while keeping it
 * working exactly as before:
 *
 *   • Tier 1 — isolated HOME. The run's writes (session history, auto-memory,
 *     caches, sqlite state) land in the sandbox home and never touch the real
 *     one. The config/auth the harness needs to behave as today is linked in
 *     read-through: for Claude we mirror all of `~/.claude` EXCEPT the known
 *     write-pollution dirs; for Codex/opencode we link the specific auth+config
 *     entries. Auth still works — the Claude token authenticates from the env
 *     even in an isolated HOME (see core/ai/auth.ts), Codex reads the linked
 *     `auth.json`. `~/.gitconfig`/`~/.npmrc` are linked so in-run git/npm keep
 *     the user's identity; `~/.ssh` is deliberately NOT linked (a delegated
 *     agent shouldn't hold your keys — pushes are the engine's job anyway).
 *
 *   • Tier 2 — a macOS seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`) profile for the auto-approve
 *     local CLIs (opencode/pi), enforced by the OS: writes are confined to the
 *     workdir + sandbox home + tmp, reads/exec/network stay open so runs behave
 *     normally. Toggle off with `WORKBENCH_SEATBELT=off` if a run needs it.
